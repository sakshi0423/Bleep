A simple program that utilizes referencing and nested for-loops in order to check and replace within a string. The program takes a small word, and then some text, then replaces every instance of the given small word with asterisks. In the original Codecademy solution for this project, this project being the final one in the "Learn C++" catalogue, the coder used a second "askerisks" function in order to replace the given text with asterisks.
